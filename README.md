# Data-Analytics Project
### Using analysis skills to explore, manipulate and visualize data

To begin, we create a database on mySQL and give the file any name.
``` mySQL
CREATE DATABASE busi;
```

Then inform mySQL of where to access this specific dataset. once the data is imported we can view a sample of the data.
```mysql
USE busi;

SELECT * FROM hr;
```

And when the importing of the data is complete, we can begin with the data cleaning process.
So, firstly we have to rename the id column, since it is written in odd characters. In this step, I changed column ID and converted the datatype from text to VARCHAR(20) this is character variable, and set it to 20 characters in that space or column.
```mysql
ALTER TABLE hr
CHANGE COLUMN Ã¯Â»Â¿id Employee_ID VARCHAR(20)NULL;
DESCRIBE hr;
```

Then checked the datatypes of all the other columns. Next, I worked with the birthdate column. This column has some inconsistant data inputs, and therefore cannot be used to get accurate information.
```mysql
SELECT birthdate FROM hr;

SET sql_safe_updates = 0;

UPDATE hr
SET birthdate = CASE
	WHEN birthdate LIKE '%/%' THEN date_format(str_to_date(birthdate, '%m/%d/%Y'),'%Y-%m-%d')
	WHEN birthdate LIKE '%-%' THEN date_format(str_to_date(birthdate, '%m-%d-%Y'),'%Y-%m-%d')
	ELSE NULL 
END;

ALTER TABLE hr
MODIFY COLUMN birthdate DATE;
```
NB: I set the SET sql_safe_updates = 0; function because the data encypted and was not to be changed.
Then moved to change the birthdate from a text datatype to a date datatype. then used a WHEN function to set the condition to the parameters that I required to convert to a date datatype. And proceeded to alter the table and modify the column.

Next, modified the column data for hire_date using the same technique used to convert the birthdate column.
```mysql
UPDATE hr
SET hire_date = CASE
	WHEN hire_date LIKE '%/%' THEN date_format(str_to_date(hire_date, '%m/%d/%Y'),'%Y-%m-%d')
	WHEN hire_date LIKE '%-%' THEN date_format(str_to_date(hire_date, '%m-%d-%Y'),'%Y-%m-%d')
	ELSE NULL 
END;

ALTER TABLE hr
MODIFY COLUMN hire_date DATE;
```

then same for termdate, but termdate dataset had (inconsistant) date and times in the same column thus, we had to remove the time and set the null or empty rows with 0000-00-00 in the year-month-day format as reqired by the question.
```mysql
UPDATE hr
SET termdate = date(str_to_date(termdate, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s UTC'))
WHERE termdate IS NOT NULL AND termdate != '';

ALTER TABLE hr
MODIFY COLUMN termdate DATE;
```
then after a new 'age' column which didn't exist was created in order to be able to answer the questions to follow,
```mysql
ALTER TABLE hr ADD COLUMN age INT;
```
and lastly, the age was calculated. Upon realization it was discovered that there was ages which were negative values and others less than 18 which is incorrect. to view the ages, we took a look at minimum and maximum values and used a SELECT statement to filter the ages to only over 18 years.
```mysql
UPDATE hr
SET age = timestampdiff(YEAR, birthdate, CURDATE());

SELECT 
	min(age) AS youngest,
    max(age) AS oldest
FROM hr;
```
